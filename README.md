Replacement for the BuildIn FreeU Implementation in Forge with additional options for animations

![fum1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a9961ff0-55a2-405b-bc4e-5ea151bf5292)

This is a try out project to check how to animate a picture using a single untouched seed. 
The idea was to alter the values of the S1 and / or S2 sliders while the seed is unchanged.
After many tests and tips by the forge community members this is the first release version.
The code is mostly the original code implemented in the forge webui by lllyasviel and the
many contributors, the additional options for the randomised or linear parameter moves are
what this project is all about written by me so far..

Make sure to install the script to your forge webui using the link
